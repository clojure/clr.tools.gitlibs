# clr.tools.gitlibs

A port of [clojure/tools.gitlibs](https://github.com/clojure/tools.gitlibs) library to ClojureCLR.

> An API for retrieving, caching, and programatically accessing git libraries.

> To access git dependencies (for example, via tools.deps), one must download git directories and working trees as indicated by git shas. This library provides this functionality and also keeps a cache of git dirs and working trees that can be reused.

## Usage

See the ClojureJVM library repo linked to above.

For configuration, the environment variables referenced are the same.  
Instead of Java system properties, this version will look at the `app.config` data.
The equivalent of `~/.gitlibs` on Windows is the the `.gitlibs` directory in the user's home directory, typically `C:/Users/<username>`.
